# McOverlay
This is a simple chrome extension to add the Northernlion McDelivery overlay to any twitch stream.

## Installation
1. Download the files from the repository using the green "<> Code" button > "Download ZIP" (or clone the GitHub repo).
2. Extract the contents of the downloaded archive.
3. In Chrome, go to `Settings > Extensions > Manage Extensions`.
4. Press the "Load Unpacked" button on the top-left side of the page and select the extracted folder.
5. Open Twitch in a chrome tab and navigate to the "McOverlay" extension. Click the extension icon and press the "Toggle McDelivery Overlay" button.

## Notes
This is a very stupid project bodged together in half an hour or so. It's pretty janky and the overlay itself is very poorly cropped.
If the overlay isn't showing up, try refreshing your Twitch tab.

If there are any issues or questions, feel free to report it as an issue on this GitHub repo.
